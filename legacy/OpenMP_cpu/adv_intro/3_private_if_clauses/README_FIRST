There are 2 exercises. 

If you develop in C/C++:

   1.) read the README_ex1_c and follow the instructions
   2.) read the README_ex2_c and follow the instructions


If you develop in FORTRAN:

   1.) read the README_ex1_F and follow the instructions
   2.) read the README_ex2_F and follow the instructions


Advice:  Read both the C and Fortran examples-- and note
         their similaries.
