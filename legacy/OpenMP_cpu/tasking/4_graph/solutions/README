1.)
   INOUT should have been used for the dependence type for e in T4 and T5.
   However the same effect could have been achieve with an OUT dependence.

     [T1]      [T2] 
    a/b| \c    /d e\ 
     | |   [T3]    [T4]
     | |           /e
     [ T5 ]_______/

   With the new dependence between T4 and T5, T4 and T5 can no longer
   executate concurrently. T5 must wait for the completion of T4. 


2.)
   The first  task should have an OUT dependent with "id" as the list variable.
   The second task should have an IN  dependent with "id" as the list variable.
   Both task should have i as firstprivate.  See codes in this directory.
