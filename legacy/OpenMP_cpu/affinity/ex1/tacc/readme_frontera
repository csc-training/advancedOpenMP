EXERCISE 1: Set up the parallel environment (affinity commands),
      execute amask_omp and
      answer questions

* First experiment: Proc_Bind = close
  ----------------

          export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
          export OMP_PLACES='{0},{4},{8},{12},{16},{20},{24},{28}'
          export OMP_PROC_BIND=close

          amask_omp                       #This shows the core view

    a.) What proc-ids do the 4 thread land on?  __ __ __ __



* Second experiment: Proc_Bind = spread
  -----------------
          export OMP_PROC_BIND=spread

          amask_omp

    a.) What proc-ids do the 4 threads land on?  __ __ __ __


* Runtime Viewing
In your idev window, execute:

        amask_omp -w 60

In another window execute the following, to see the thread occupation:

        module htop        #required at TACC, others sites may not have htop
        htop               #control-c to exit

Select one of the threads, and then type "a", you will see the affinity mask.
Hit escapte to leave affinity mode.  (Note, you can reset the affinity here!)

Execute:
       show_affinity       #@TACC only, gives a listing of the affinity


Execute:
       top
       hit the "1" key to get the threads.
