* First experiment: 2 MPI tasks, 28 threads per task
  ----------------

Exit your present idev session, and create a new one:

      export OMP_NUM_THREADS=28
      export OMP_PLACES=cores
      export OMP_PROC_BIND=spread

      ibrun -np 2 amask_hybrid

   1a.) Note that a PURE MPI mask is reported
        so that you can view the mask for each MPI rank.
        The next list is for the hybrid execution-- it
        shows the threads for each rank.

        At the OpenMP fork, the affinity of the threads is
        made from set bits of the parent MPI process.

        How has each thread mask been modified from
        the parent MPI rank's mask?  ___________________

        Do you recognize the pattern from the pure OpenMP runs?


* Second experiment: change abstract name (OMP_PLACES) to sockets
  -----------------

      export OMP_PLACES=sockets

      ibrun -np 2 amask_hybrid

    2a.)  Where can each thread execute? _______________


* Third Experiment:  What is the default (NON-OPENMP) affinity for this hybrid job:

      unset OMP_PROC_BIND
      unset OMP_PLACES

      ibrun -np 2 amask_hybrid

    3a.)  Where can each thread execute?         ____________________
    3b.) Why do experiments 2 and 3 turn out the same?   _____________
