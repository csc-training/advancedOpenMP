HYBRID EXECUTION:

* First experiment: 2 MPI tasks, 12 threads per process
  ----------------

Set up an environment for using 2 MPI tasks, with each
MPI process have 12 threads.

      export OMP_NUM_THREADS=12
      export OMP_PLACES=cores

      ibrun -np 2 amask_hybrid

   1a.) Note that a PURE MPI mask is reported
        so that you can view the mask for each MPI rank.
        The next report is for the hybrid execution-- it
        shows the threads for each rank.

        At the OpenMP fork, the affinity of the threads can
        only be made from set bits of the parent MPI process.

        How has each thread mask been modified from
        the parent MPI rank's mask?

       



* Second experiment: change abstract name (OMP_PLACES) to sockets
  -----------------

      export OMP_PLACES=sockets

      ibrun -np 2 amask_hybrid

    2a.)  Where can each thread execute?


* Third Experiment:  What is the default (NON-OPENMP) affinity for this hybrid job:

      unset OMP_PROC_BIND 
      unset OMP_PLACES

      ibrun -np 2 amask_hybrid

    3a.)  Where can each thread execute?
