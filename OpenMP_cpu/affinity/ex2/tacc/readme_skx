* First experiment: 8 threads with 8 places; each place is 2 HW threads
  ----------------

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
export OMP_PLACES='{0,48},{1,49},{2,50},{3,51},{4,52},{5,53},{6,54},{7,55}'
export OMP_PROC_BIND=spread                  
                                             
                                         These are HardWare Thread (HWT) numbers
                                         They are also called proc-ids.
                                           |
                                           v
            '{0,48},{1,49},{2,50},{3,51},{4,52},{5,53},{6,54},{7,55}'
              ^  ^
              1st place.  OpenMP Threads id 0 can run on either HWT
              The 2 HWT's of core 0 are 0,48.
              The 2 HWT's of core 1 are 1,49.
              The 2 HWT's of core 2 are 2,50.
              The 2 HWT's of core 3 are 3,51.
               ...
               
amask_omp -vk 
amask_omp -vc   #default for KNL

   1a.) What is the difference between the views? (Hint: kernel and core)
   1a.) How could you have written this in interval format?
   1b.) What would you use for just the 2nd HWthread?                     Ans:{48}:8



* Second experiment: increase to 16 threads
  -----------------
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=16

amask_omp 

   2a.) Are the places "oversubscribed".
   2b.) What has happen in the distribution?
   2c.) Is it round-robin? (Why not?)


* Fourth experiment:  explore OMP_DISPLAY_ENV
  -----------------
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
export OMP_DISPLAY_ENV=1
amask_omp 

   4a.) What does DISPLAY_ENV do?
   4b.) Set places to something incorrect, e.g.

      e.g. use this incorrect syntax (forgot to separate with commas):
      export OMP_PLACES='{0,48}{1,49}{2,50}{3,51}{4,52}{5,53}{6,54}{7,55}'
