* First experiment: 2 MPI tasks, 24 threads per task
  ----------------

Exit your present idev session, and create a new one:

      export OMP_NUM_THREADS=24
      export OMP_PLACES=cores
      export OMP_PROC_BIND=spread

      ibrun -np 2 amask_hybrid

   1a.) Note that a PURE MPI mask is reported
        to that you can view the mask for each MPI rank.
        The next list is for the hybrid execution-- it
        shows the threads for each rank.

        At the OpenMP fork, the affinity of the threads can
        only be made from set bits of the parent MPI process.

        How has each thread mask been modified from
        the parent MPI rank's mask?

       



* Second experiment: change abstract name (OMP_PLACES) to threads
  -----------------

      export OMP_PLACES=threads

      ibrun -np 2  amask_hybrid

    2a.)  How many threads are on a core?
